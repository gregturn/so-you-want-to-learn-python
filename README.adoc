== So You Want To Learn Python

This project is about http://blog.greglturnquist.com/2014/07/a-new-project-in-my-spare-time-helping-my-nephew-create-games-with-python-and-pygame.html[helping my nephew learn Python].
But it can be your project as well.

The page itself is found on the https://github.com/gregturn/so-you-want-to-learn-python/tree/gh-pages[gh-pages branch]. In case you didn't know, this sets me up to generate HTML
and host it at http://gregturn.github.io/so-you-want-to-learn-python/[So You Want To Learn Python].

Feel free to fork it and make your own edits. Set up a gh-pages branch, and host your own site.

Cheers!
